The fda run is looking a little more interesting.  It still does not currently look good enough, but it might be a place for more exploration.   The following is the summation of classifications:

pt <- predict(m, training[,nonNAIndeciesAndDoablePredictors])
> sum(pt == "A")
[1] 4909
> sum(pt == "B")
[1] 4992
> sum(pt == "C")
[1] 6261
> sum(pt == "D")
[1] 7746
> sum(pt == "E")
[1] 3992
> 

Given that used the upScaling, I would have expected the numbers to look to be closer together.
