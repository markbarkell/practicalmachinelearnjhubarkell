# practicalmachinelearnjhubarkell

The Coursera Data Science Specialization assignment for the Practical Machine Learning.  This is the repository for what is the peer reviewed assignment Mark Barkell is creating.

## Improvements which could be made

Improvments that could be made to this repository include making of graphs, describing the accuracy measures of the training data, making part of the data as a validation set.  Of course, other improvments that a reviewer pointed out is that I did not explain the code as well as it could have been explained.  I likely could have made cross validation better -- though the goal was to fit, and even overfit, the hidden testing set.

I agree that I could have added more information.  I did also concern myself with keeping the document short.  It was supposed to be under 2000 words.  I did not bother to do a word count on the document before submitting to my peers in the class for review.  Having now run a 'wc -w', I do know I could have made it almost 400 words longer.

## Why are the improvements not going to be made

I do not see any profit in working with the data set other than having passed the *Practical Machine Learning* from **John Hopkins University** offered via Coursera.org.

## What did I learn

I learned about some various computational methods for classifying data.  I noticed with the choices of features that I made some training methods would seem to never quit running -- so they were not converging.   Amoung those seemed to be especially *rpart*, but also seemed to be *rf*.  I found that the *glm* training method is only useful for bipartate training.

Of course, the file *PracticalMachineLearingJHUCourseraOther.Rmd* contains the training methods I wrote.
